Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
The command line is a direct connection to the inner workings of a computer using only text.

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english describe what they do.
1. cd <directory name> - Change directory (folder)
2. mkdir <directory name> - Create a new folder
3. touch <filename> - Create a new file
4. rm <file or directory name> - Remove a file or folder (once deleted it cannot be retrieved)
5. cd ~ - Go to home directory
6. ls - list all (non-hidden) items within a directory
7. pwd - Print Working Directory (show your current directory)
8. cd .. - Go to the parent folder (the folder above current folder)
9. mv <file.md> <newfile.md> - Move (in this case effectively rename) file to newfile
10. cp <file.md> <directory> - Copy file to another directory.
